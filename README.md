## Project Introduction 

Crises seem to be an unavoidable part of our global economic system; affecting our society and lives in unprendictable ways. However, a pattern that seems to 
continuously repeat itself is _the change in housing prices_.
With this project we aimed to analyse the effect of the current health and economic crisis, the Covid-19 pandemic, in household prices in the UK.

## Questions & Data used 

Using data from the past 16 years, from the UK Government and the National Census website we examined past recessions, namely the 2008 crisis, and used graphs to visualy represent the trends of the House Market in England and the Westmidlands to help us determine:

  **1. What trends have the UK housing prices and sales followed for the past 12 years?**
  	*	_How have they been affected by the 2008 financial crash and Covid-19?_
   
  **2. Where is housing prices and sales volume highest in the UK?**
  	*	_Using the most recent data from July 2021_
     
 **3. Where is the highest sales volume and house price within the Westmidlands?**
 	*	_A comparison between Birmingham, Coventry, Dudley, Sandwell, Solihull, Walsall, Wolverhampton, using the most recent data (July 2021)_
	
**4. How does the Westmidlands compare with the other regions of England when it comes to housing prices and purchase volume?**

**DATA**:

For our datasets we used a collection of data from the _Office for National Statistics_ and _The UK Government Website_ of the UK housing market starting from 2005, that analyses the average house prices, sales, number of houses and different type of housing, it is divided by country, cities, regions, and counties, and extends until July 2021.
